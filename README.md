# Coding Interview Notes

Coding interviews can be one of the most stressful interviews for programmers.

This repo is inspired by [Kevin Naughton Jr.'s work](https://github.com/kdn251/interviews) on interview preparation.
Kevin's advice has four steps for what to learn in order:

1. Data Structures
2. [Big-O Analysis](./big-o.md)
3. Algorithms - sorting algorithms, graph-based algorithms, other classic textbook algorithms
4. Problem solve - use a website like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to practice how to approach and ultimately solve

## Grokking the Coding Interview

It's also valuable to be able to recognize patterns in coding questions, which is
the approach taken in [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
by [DesignGurus](https://www.designgurus.org/).

- [The Sliding Window Pattern](./sliding-window.md)

## Cracking the Coding Interview

I will also be going through the chapters in this classic book to get better at
coding interviews.

> Note: I have the 6th Edition of the book

- [Introduction Part VI: Big O](./big-o.md)
- [Chapter 1-4: Data Structures](./data-structures.md)

## Terminology

- [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
- [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
- [Space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity)
- [In-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)
- [Brute-force search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search)
